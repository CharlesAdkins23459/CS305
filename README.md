Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.  Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. I was asked to examine Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities.


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I accurately identified their software security vulnerabilities, documented them and appropriately addressed false positives.  Secure coding ensures that the data and the programs users are safe from malicious threats, brining trust and reputational value to our ability to create and deliver secure systems.


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was to determine which elements of the diagram was relevant to the scneario and how it could be applied.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

You increase layers of security by implementing the most broad layer of security first then drilling down into the specifics of the system, program and its data needs.  I would use the same systematic approach to assessing vulnerabilities in the future to ensure we capture all occurrences and concerns.



How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I implemented several scenario-based tests to ensure that the code was functional and that it handled errors and input validations appropriately.  I ran dependency check tests and examined the results to verify I hadn't introduce new vulnerabilities, while also supressing false positives to maintain an accurate view of the systems status.



What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Obviously framework documentation helps us understand how to implement aspects of code, APIs and plugins reduce coding overhead, and implementing industry standard coding practices ensure that we are protecting ourselves, the system, data and client.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them my familiarity with software security concepts, implementations and analysis.
